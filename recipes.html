            <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings.  They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>

                <li>Use a thin spatula to loosen the pancake, flip it over continue to cook on the other side for about 30 seconds.</li>  
                <li>Transfer to a plate. </li>

            <p>Unlike Indian or Thai curry, Japanese curry is more savory than spicy. It's an exemplary comfort food and one of the most-loved home-cooked dishes in Japan.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper</li>
                <li>Water</li>

            <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>

                <li>Pour 2 cups water into a microwave-safe bowl. Break curry sauce mix into pieces and add to water. Heat in the microwave until sauce mix has completely dissolved.</li>
                <li>Remove chicken from the skillet. Cut into cubes, return to the skillet, and pour curry sauce over top.</li>
                <li>Stir in peas, potatoes, mushrooms, carrots, and onion. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
